# cse-auto-appendix
automatically generate pdf code appendix for CSE projects

screenshotting manually is boring and using an existing solution is no fun, so why not write one?

You can just open the screenshot.html page in your browser (only tested on Chrome) and select your project repository. Later on there should be a feature to select patterns to ignore

You can then download it as a pdf by simply using your browser's print function and printing to pdf. 

It doesn't fully work yet, but hopefully that will change soon.
